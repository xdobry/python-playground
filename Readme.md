# pygame python playground

I collect here my example programs to try out pygame

Threre is pygame_ping.py example for some kind of breakout ping game.

There some optic demos and physic simulation for ball collisions.

You need to install pygame and numpy first

    python -m pip install -U pygame --user
    python -m pip install -U numpy --user

Start all demos using.

    python START_ALL_DEMOS.py

## Open Ideas

 * Use Perlin Noise
 * Use numpy and 3d dot graphics, projection matrix
 * Use simple line 3d graphic (extract from svg)
 * Try processing like, matrix push pop approach
